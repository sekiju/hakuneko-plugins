# My personal pack of HakuNeko plugins

### How to install?
Download this repository and unpack files from folders to HakuNeko plugins directory.
You can find it [this](https://hakuneko.download/docs/install/#user-plugins).
<br>
**Don't paste plugins with folder! (HakuNeko cannot search files in folders)**

The catalog should look like this:
<br>

```
./hakuneko.plugins/
│
├── Plugin.mjs
└── Plugin.png
```

**Don't forget to go to Github once in a while, maybe I've updated the plugin you need.**
